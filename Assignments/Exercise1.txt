What is Emmet?

Emmet is a web development toolkit that allows for efficient and rapid HTML and CSS coding. It provides a set of abbreviations 
and shortcuts that expand into complete HTML or CSS code snippets. Emmet is designed to enhance productivity and streamline the
 process of writing code, particularly for repetitive tasks.

With Emmet, you can write shorthand expressions, called Emmet abbreviations, and quickly expand them into HTML or CSS code. 
For example, you can type ul>li*5 and expand it using Emmet to generate an unordered list with five list items.

Emmet supports a wide range of operations and features, such as nested elements, attributes, numbering, text snippets, mathematical 
operations, and more. It is widely supported in popular code editors, including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and others.

Emmet is especially useful for front-end web developers who need to write HTML and CSS code quickly and efficiently. It helps save 
time and reduces the amount of manual typing required for repetitive code structures, allowing developers to focus more on the logic 
and functionality of their web applications.

Difference Between Library and Framework?

 a library is a collection of code that developers can use as needed, giving them more control over their program's flow. On the 
 other hand, a framework provides a structured environment where the developer follows predefined patterns and architecture, allowing 
 the framework to control the program's flow.

What is CDN? Why do we use it?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a distributed network of servers located in different geographical locations around the 
world. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other files, to end-users in a fast
 and efficient manner.

When a user requests content from a website, the request is routed to the nearest CDN server instead of the origin server where the 
content is hosted. The CDN server closest to the user's location serves the content, reducing the distance the data has to travel and 
improving the overall response time. This process is known as content caching.

CDNs offer improved performance, scalability, reliability, and global reach, making them an essential component for delivering content 
efficiently in today's digital landscape.

Why react is known as react?

React is known as React because it revolves around the concept of reacting to changes in data and rendering the user interface accordingly. 
The name "React" signifies its core principle of efficiently updating the user interface in response to changes in application state.

The name "React" reflects the reactive nature of the library. React introduces a virtual representation of the user interface called the 
Virtual DOM. When there are changes in the underlying data or state of the application, React compares the previous and current states of 
the Virtual DOM and efficiently updates only the necessary components, avoiding unnecessary re-renders. This approach allows for efficient 
and performant updates to the user interface.

Additionally, React embraces the concept of reusable UI components, which are independent and self-contained units of the user interface. 
These components react to changes in data, rendering their output accordingly. The component-based architecture is a fundamental aspect of 
React, enabling developers to build modular, reusable, and maintainable UIs.

What is cross-origin in the script tag?

he crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used to control how the browser handles loading and executing JavaScript files from different 
origins or domains.

When a script is loaded from the same origin (same domain, protocol, and port), there are typically no restrictions on accessing or executing 
the script. However, when a script is loaded from a different origin, the browser applies security restrictions known as the Same-Origin Policy.

What is the difference between react and react-dom?

React is the core library that handles the logic and structure of building user interfaces, while ReactDOM is a companion package that provides 
the necessary tools and methods for interacting with the browser's DOM to render and update React components. They work together to enable the 
development of dynamic and interactive user interfaces in web applications.

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

When developing a React application, it is common to use react.development.js for easy debugging, meaningful error messages, and a more 
interactive development experience. It helps identify issues and provides helpful warnings and guidance during development.

On the other hand, for production deployments, it is recommended to use react.production.js to optimize the application's performance 
and reduce the file size. The smaller file size results in faster downloads and improves the runtime efficiency of the application.

When using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve React files, you can choose the appropriate version (react.development.js or 
react.production.js) based on whether you are developing or deploying the application. In development, you may prefer the unminified 
version with additional debugging features, while in production, the optimized and minified version is more suitable for performance 
and efficiency.
