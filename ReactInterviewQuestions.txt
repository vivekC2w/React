1. Why we use react when JS is already there?
	1.  React is a JavaScript library that focuses specifically on building user interfaces. It provides a component-based approach 
	to UI development, allowing developers to create reusable and modular UI components.By using React, we can separate the concerns 
	of UI development from the overall JavaScript logic of the application, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.
	
	2. Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React efficiently updates and re-renders only the necessary 
	parts of the UI by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM. This approach significantly improves performance and minimizes 
	unnecessary updates, resulting in faster and more responsive user interfaces.
	
	3.React encourages the development of reusable components, which can be composed together to build complex user interfaces. 
	This reusability saves development time and effort, as developers can leverage existing components rather than building everything 
	from scratch. React's component architecture also promotes code modularity and maintainability.
	
2. Class based component 
	Class-based components in React are an older way of defining components before the introduction of functional components and hooks in 
	React 16.8. Class components are created using JavaScript classes and extend the React.Component base class provided by the React library.

	Here's an example of a simple class-based component in React:
	import React, { Component } from 'react';

		class MyClassComponent extends Component {
		  constructor(props) {
			super(props);
			this.state = {
			  count: 0
			};
		  }

		  handleClick = () => {
			this.setState(prevState => ({
			  count: prevState.count + 1
			}));
		  }

		  render() {
			return (
			  <div>
				<p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
				<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment</button>
			  </div>
			);
		  }
		}
		
		In the example above, MyClassComponent extends the Component class provided by React. It has a constructor where the initial state is set,
		and there's a handleClick method that updates the state when the button is clicked. The component's state is accessed using this.state 
		within the render method.

		Class components also provide lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount that allow you to 
		perform actions at specific stages of a component's life.

		However, with the introduction of React hooks in React 16.8, functional components became the recommended way of building components. 
		Hooks provide a simpler and more flexible approach to manage state and handle component lifecycle. Functional components and hooks are 
		generally favored for new projects as they offer better performance and readability.

		Here's the equivalent example using a functional component and hooks:
		import React, { useState } from 'react';

		function MyFunctionalComponent() {
		  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

		  const handleClick = () => {
			setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
		  }

		  return (
			<div>
			  <p>Count: {count}</p>
			  <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
			</div>
		  );
		}
		
		In this functional component, the useState hook is used to manage the state, and the handleClick function uses the setCount function to 
		update the state.

		Functional components with hooks are generally considered the preferred way of building components in React due to their simplicity, 
		reusability, and performance benefits. However, class components are still supported in React and may be necessary when working with
		older codebases or libraries that rely on them.


3.Life cycle methods:
	Lifecycle methods in React are special methods that are called at different stages of a component's lifecycle. They provide an opportunity 
	to perform actions or respond to specific events during different phases of the component's existence.

	Here are some of the commonly used lifecycle methods in React class components:

	componentDidMount: This method is called after the component has been rendered to the DOM. It is commonly used to initiate API calls, 
	set up event listeners, or perform any necessary setup that requires access to the DOM.

	componentDidUpdate: This method is called after the component has been updated and re-rendered. It receives the previous props and state 
	as parameters, allowing you to compare them with the current props and state. It is often used to perform side effects based on prop or 
	state changes, such as making additional API calls or updating the DOM.

	componentWillUnmount: This method is called right before the component is unmounted and removed from the DOM. It is typically used to perform 
	cleanup tasks such as canceling API requests, removing event listeners, or clearing timers to avoid memory leaks.

	shouldComponentUpdate: This method is called before a component is re-rendered, allowing you to control whether the re-rendering should 
	occur or not. By default, React re-renders a component whenever its props or state change, but implementing this method gives you the ability 
	to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

	It's important to note that with the introduction of React hooks, such as the useEffect hook, the usage of lifecycle methods has been largely 
	replaced in functional components. Hooks provide a more declarative way to achieve similar functionality.

	Here's an example of a class component that utilizes some of these lifecycle methods:
	import React, { Component } from 'react';

	class MyComponent extends Component {	
	  constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = {
		  count: 0
		};
	  }

	  componentDidMount() {
		console.log('Component mounted');
	  }

	  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
		if (prevState.count !== this.state.count) {
		  console.log('Count changed:', this.state.count);
		}
	  }

	  componentWillUnmount() {
		console.log('Component will unmount');
	  }

	  handleClick = () => {
		this.setState(prevState => ({
		  count: prevState.count + 1
		}));
	  }

	  render() {
		return (
		  <div>
			<p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
			<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment</button>
		  </div>
		);
	  }
	}
	
	In this example, the componentDidMount method logs a message to the console when the component is mounted, the componentDidUpdate method 
	logs the count value when it changes, and the componentWillUnmount method logs a message when the component is about to be unmounted.

	It's worth noting that in functional components, you can achieve similar functionality using the useEffect hook, which allows you to specify 
	the equivalent of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount using a single hook.
	
4. Memoization is a technique used in computer science and programming to optimize the performance of functions by caching the results of expensive 
function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. It is particularly useful when a function is called multiple times 
with the same arguments, as it avoids redundant computations.

In JavaScript, memoization is often implemented using closures and higher-order functions. Here's a simple example:

function memoize(func) {
  const cache = {};

  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    
    if (cache[key]) {
      return cache[key];
    }

    const result = func.apply(null, args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  };
}

// Example function to be memoized
function expensiveFunction(n) {
  console.log('Computing...');
  return n * 2;
}

const memoizedExpensiveFunction = memoize(expensiveFunction);

console.log(memoizedExpensiveFunction(5)); // Output: Computing... 10
console.log(memoizedExpensiveFunction(5)); // Output: 10 (cached result)
console.log(memoizedExpensiveFunction(8)); // Output: Computing... 16
console.log(memoizedExpensiveFunction(8)); // Output: 16 (cached result)

In the example above, the memoize function takes in a function (func) and returns a new function. The new function checks if the result for the 
given arguments (args) is already present in the cache object. If it is, the cached result is returned. Otherwise, the original function is invoked 
(func.apply(null, args)), and its result is stored in the cache for future use.

When memoizedExpensiveFunction is called multiple times with the same arguments, the expensive computation inside expensiveFunction is only 
performed once. Subsequent calls with the same arguments retrieve the cached result, resulting in improved performance.

Memoization can significantly optimize the execution time of functions that involve heavy computations, complex calculations, or API calls. 
However, it is important to note that memoization is most effective when the function's result is deterministic based on its arguments. If a 
function has side effects or produces different results for the same inputs, memoization may lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

It's worth mentioning that libraries such as Lodash provide built-in memoization functions that can simplify the process of memoizing functions 
in JavaScript.


5. React.memo is a higher-order component (HOC) provided by React that helps optimize the performance of functional components by memoizing 
their rendered output. It is similar to the concept of memoization but specifically designed for React components.

By wrapping a functional component with React.memo, React will only re-render the component if its props have changed. If the props remain 
the same between re-renders, React will reuse the previously rendered result, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance.

Here's an example of how to use React.memo:

import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic and JSX here
});

export default MyComponent;
In the example above, MyComponent is a functional component wrapped with React.memo. The component will only be re-rendered if the values of prop1 
or prop2 change. 
If the component is re-rendered with the same props, React will reuse the previously rendered result, bypassing the rendering process.

It's important to note that React.memo performs a shallow equality check on the component's props. This means that if the props are objects or 
arrays, a change in their reference (rather than their content) will trigger a re-render. To optimize the memoization further, you can implement 
custom comparison logic by providing a second argument to React.memo in the form of a comparison function.

const MyComponent = React.memo(({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic and JSX here
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison logic here
});

The custom comparison function receives the previous props (prevProps) and the next props (nextProps) as arguments. It should return true if the 
props are considered equal and false if they are different.

React.memo can be particularly useful when working with large component trees or when components receive expensive-to-calculate props. By memoizing 
components with React.memo, unnecessary re-renders can be avoided, 
leading to better performance and improved user experience.

It's important to note that React.memo is not a replacement for proper optimization techniques, and it should be used judiciously. It is recommended 
to profile and measure the performance of your application to determine if using React.memo provides noticeable performance benefits in specific 
components.



6.The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used in React and other frameworks that involves creating a lightweight, in-memory representation of the 
actual DOM. It acts as a layer between 
the application and the browser's DOM and provides a more efficient way to update and render components.

Here's a brief explanation of the virtual DOM and its benefits:

Virtual DOM as a representation: The virtual DOM is a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the actual DOM. It contains information 
about elements, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

Diffing algorithm: When a component's state or props change in React, a process called reconciliation occurs. React uses a diffing algorithm to 
compare the previous virtual DOM representation with the new one and efficiently determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM.

The diffing algorithm performs a tree-based comparison of the old and new virtual DOM, identifying the differences between them. It optimizes the 
update process by minimizing the number of actual DOM operations required.

By only updating the necessary parts of the DOM, React avoids costly full re-rendering operations, resulting in significant performance improvements.

The diffing algorithm operates in O(N) time complexity, where N represents the number of nodes in the virtual DOM tree. This is much more efficient 
compared to directly manipulating the actual DOM, which can have a time complexity of O(n^3) for certain operations like re-rendering a large list.

React's diffing algorithm applies heuristics and optimizations to further enhance performance. It performs a top-down, depth-first comparison of the 
virtual DOM tree, looking for differences at each level and prioritizing the updates based on certain assumptions and strategies.

Some of these strategies include key-based reconciliation (using unique keys to track and reorder elements efficiently) and component-level 
memoization (avoiding re-rendering of components if their props haven't changed).

By leveraging these techniques, React minimizes the number of DOM updates and significantly improves rendering performance, making it a popular 
choice for building complex and dynamic user interfaces.

It's important to note that while the virtual DOM and the diffing algorithm are powerful tools for optimizing UI updates, they come with a tradeoff 
in terms of memory overhead. The virtual DOM introduces an additional layer of abstraction and requires memory to store the virtual representation 
of the DOM. However, in most cases, the performance benefits outweigh the memory costs.

Overall, the virtual DOM and the efficient diffing algorithm in React provide a performant way to update and render components, resulting in a 
smoother user experience and better application performance.


7. Lazy loading in React is a technique used to dynamically load components or other assets only when they are actually needed, rather than 
loading them upfront during the initial page load. It helps optimize performance by reducing the initial load time and minimizing the amount 
of code or assets that need to be downloaded.

React provides a built-in feature called React.lazy, along with the Suspense component, to enable lazy loading of components.

Here's an example of how to use lazy loading in React:
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazy load the component
const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

// Render the component using Suspense
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <MyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
In the example above, the MyComponent is lazily loaded using the lazy function and the import() function syntax. When the MyComponent is 
encountered during rendering, React will dynamically load its code and any other dependencies (such as CSS or images) on-demand.

The Suspense component is used to wrap the lazily loaded component and provide a fallback UI (in this case, a "Loading..." message) 
while the component is being loaded. This ensures that the user sees a loading state until the lazy component is fully loaded.

It's important to note a few considerations when using lazy 
Lazy loading works with default exports. Make sure to use export default when defining the lazily loaded component.

Code splitting: Lazy loading leverages code splitting to create separate chunks for each lazily loaded component. This allows the browser 
to load only the necessary code for the current page, improving performance.

Suspense for data fetching: While the example above shows the use of Suspense for lazy loading components, Suspense can also be used for 
handling asynchronous data fetching. By wrapping data-fetching components or hooks with Suspense, you can display fallback UI until the data 
is loaded.

Lazy loading is especially beneficial when dealing with large applications or components that are not required immediately upon page load. 
By loading components on-demand, you can reduce the initial bundle size and improve the overall performance of your React application.
